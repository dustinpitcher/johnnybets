**Date:** January 11, 2026

## Executive Summary
We have identified significant line discrepancies in the Buffalo Bills @ Jacksonville Jaguars game (18:02 UTC). Specifically, there is a **Moneyline Arbitrage** (guaranteed profit) and a massive **Totals Middle** (5.5 point window).

## Allocation Plan

### 1. The "Free Money" Moneyline Arb ($200 Allocation)
*Opportunity:* The books disagree on the favorite.
*   **Bet A:** $100 on **Jacksonville Jaguars Moneyline (+110)** at DraftKings.
*   **Bet B:** $100 on **Buffalo Bills Moneyline (+105)** at MyBookie.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   If Jags win: Return $210. Net Profit: +$10.
    *   If Bills win: Return $205. Net Profit: +$5.
*   *Risk:* None (excluding void rules/book rules).

### 2. The "Golden Middle" Totals Play ($200 Allocation)
*Opportunity:* Bovada has the total at 51, while others are at 45.5.
*   **Bet A:** $100 on **Over 45.5 (-115)** at DraftKings or BetMGM.
*   **Bet B:** $100 on **Under 51 (-105)** at Bovada.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   **The Middle (Score 46-50):** BOTH bets win. Profit ~$182.
    *   **Miss:** One wins, one loses. Net loss is only the vig (approx $9-$10).
*   *Value:* You are risking ~$10 to win ~$182 if the score lands on 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50. This is an exceptional +EV wager.

## Game 2: 49ers @ Eagles
*   **Status:** Lines are efficient (-6 spread, 44.5 total).
*   **Recommendation:** No action recommended yet. Preserve capital for the high-value opportunities in Game 1.

## Execution Notes
*   **Speed is key:** The MyBookie and Bovada lines are likely outliers and will move quickly.
*   **Check Limits:** Ensure you can get the full $100 down on the outliers first (MyBookie/Bovada) before hedging at the major books (DK/MGM).
