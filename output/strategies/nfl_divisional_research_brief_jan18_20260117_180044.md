# NFL Divisional Round Research Strategy & Brief
**Date:** January 17, 2026
**Focus:** Divisional Round Games (Jan 18) & Futures Implications

## 1. Macro Market Landscape
*   **Seismic Shift:** The Denver Broncos' upset over the Bills (33-30 OT) has disrupted AFC futures. The Bills were a Super Bowl favorite; their exit sucks liquidity out of "Favorites" futures and opens a path for the winner of Texans/Pats.
*   **Kalshi Sentiment:** High volume on Patriots and Rams suggests market confidence in these teams advancing, despite public underdog love for the Bears.

## 2. Matchup 1: Houston Texans @ New England Patriots (20:00 UTC)
*   **The Narrative:** "Stroud vs. Belichickian Defense" (even if post-BB, the system remains).
*   **Key Intel:** 
    *   **CRITICAL:** WR Nico Collins is **OUT**.
    *   **CRITICAL:** Pats CB Christian Gonzalez is **IN**.
*   **Hypothesis (The "Collins Void"):** Without his alpha WR1, Stroud will struggle against a healthy Pats secondary that can bracket the remaining options. The market total dropping (42.5 -> 40.5) confirms this.
*   **Research Directives:**
    *   **Fade Stroud:** Investigate Stroud's splits *without* Nico Collins.
    *   **Target TE/RB Receiving:** Check Dalton Schultz or Mixon receiving props as check-down beneficiaries.
    *   **Pats Game Script:** With a lead, do the Patriots lean heavy on Rhamondre Stevenson? Check his carry props vs Texans run D metrics.

## 3. Matchup 2: Los Angeles Rams @ Chicago Bears (23:30 UTC)
*   **The Narrative:** "Warm weather Rams in freezing Chicago."
*   **Key Intel:** 
    *   **RLM Alert:** Public is heavy on Bears (70%+), but line stays Rams -3.5. Sharps are fading the "weather narrative."
    *   **Health:** Rams O-Line (Dotson) and Stafford are healthy.
*   **Hypothesis (The "Weather Trap"):** The public is overvaluing the cold. Stafford is elite against playoff-caliber teams (EPA/play). The Rams' offensive variance is low (consistent efficiency).
*   **Research Directives:**
    *   **Stafford vs. Zone:** Bears play heavy zone. Analyze Stafford’s efficiency vs. Zone coverage this season.
    *   **Kyren Williams Usage:** In cold weather with a lead (if Rams cover), does Kyren see 20+ touches? Check Bears rush defense DVOA.
    *   **Fade Caleb/Bears Air:** If Rams lead, Caleb Williams is forced to throw into a secondary getting healthier. Look for interception props.

## 4. Execution Plan
1.  **Prop Alpha Scan:** Run `analyze_player_props` for Stroud (under), Kyren Williams (over), and Stafford (efficiency).
2.  **Arb Check:** Scan for mispriced lines on "Nico Collins replacement" props (e.g., Tank Dell or Schultz).
3.  **Futures Hedge:** Re-evaluate AFC Championship prices now that Denver is in.
