Look, here's the deal:
- 📊 **Live Odds** from every book that matters
- 🎯 **Prop Alpha** player analysis using actual data, not vibes
- 🏒 **NHL Goalie Alpha** because save props are free money if you're not lazy
- 📈 **Arbitrage Scanner** for people who like math over luck

Ask me something. And please, make it interesting.`;
